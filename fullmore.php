                    Eating chicken herbed masala not only tantalizes the taste buds but also provides a plethora of nutrition benefits that align well with fitness goals. Chicken is an excellent source of lean protein, essential for muscle repair and growth. 
                    <br>The combination of herbs in the masala introduces a spectrum of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, contributing to overall well-being. Herbs such as coriander, cumin, and turmeric not only enhance the flavor but also bring forth potential health benefits, including improved digestion and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

                    Place the chicken cutlets between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet (or the flat side of a chef's knife) until about 1/3-inch thick. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.</p>

                        Put the flour on a medium plate. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the chicken in the flour to fully coat, shaking off any excess.</p>

                        Add 1/2 cup of the broth, the sun-dried tomatoes and rosemary to any remaining drippings in the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute to plump the tomatoes. Add the mushrooms, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook until the mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes.</p>
